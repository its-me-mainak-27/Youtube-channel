                    Shantiniketan was established in 1901 by the Nobel Laureate and poet Rabindranath Tagore. The name translates to "The Abode of Peace" in Sanskrit. The area began as a meditation center in 1863, founded by Tagore's father, Maharishi Debendranath. Rabindranath Tagore wrote many of his literary works at Santiniketan. 
Shantiniketan is a residential school and art center based on ancient Indian traditions. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The school's objective is to make learning a natural part of life. The first step towards this goal is to establish a sense of oneness with nature
The town is known for its literary and artistic heritage, with the notable figures being Rabindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose. In addition, the Visva Bharati also serves as Shantiniketan's cultural center.
